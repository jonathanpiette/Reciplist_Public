Reciplist_bug
==========

This repo doesn't have any code, it's just a convenient dumping ground for any issues users might find in the test builds for DQ1-haxe and DQ2-haxe.

# Instructions (for testers)

### 1. Log in / Sign up for a Github account
You'll need a Github account to report issues and bugs.

### 2. Ask to become a collaborator if you're really serious
Normal users can't add labels and do much besides create and comment on issues. But if you really, really, like hanging out on our bugtracker for some reason, I can make you a collaborator and give you more power. It's like being a forum moderator, but for bug tracking. Just ping me @larsiusprime in some issue comment if you're into this sort of thing.

### 3. Learn how to report a bug! *This is very important!*

In order to fix a bug, we have to be able to reproduce the error or problem you've encountered.

Therefore, please follow the example format below.

(Or just take a look at the [EXAMPLE ISSUE](https://github.com/larsiusprime/tdrpg-bugs/issues/1))

##### BASIC INFORMATION:
```
*Version # is at the bottom-right of the settings screen
**Optional info is just anything else you think might be important
```

*This information lets us know which build/version of the game has a problem*

##### STEPS TO REPRODUCE:
```
1. Create a new Recipe
2. Tapp on add ingredient
3. Dismiss the view
4. Tapp on new steps
...
```

*If we can't reproduce the bug, we can't fix it!*

##### WHAT I EXPECTED TO HAPPEN:
```
I expected to see the screen to write my new step
```

*Knowing what you were actually expecting to happen is much more helpful than only knowing what the error was.*

##### WHAT HAPPENED INSTEAD:
```
The app crash
When I relaunch the app I was expecting to continue my recipe but I had to start from scratch
```

*This lets us know what the allegedly bad result was.*
